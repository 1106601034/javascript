> FetchPostList Walkthrough

  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:63 Defines the FetchPostList component so it can be  
  rendered elsewhere in the UI.
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:64 Declares a local Post type to describe the shape  
  of each fetched record (id plus title).
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:65 Sets up posts state to hold the fetched list so   
  React can re-render when it changes.
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:66 Tracks whether a request is currently running,    
  letting the UI disable the button or show loading feedback.                         
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:67 Stores any fetch error so the component can       
  surface problems to the user.                                                       
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:68 Records if the user has ever attempted a fetch,   
  allowing the UI to show a “No posts” message only after the first try.              
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:70 Starts the click handler that actually performs   
  the fetch when the button is pressed.                                               
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:71 Marks the request as in-progress for immediate    
  UI feedback.                                                                        
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:72 Clears any previous error so stale errors don’t   
  linger during a new attempt.                                                        
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:73 Flags that at least one fetch was triggered,      
  gating “empty” messaging.                                                           
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:75 Begins the try block to attempt the network       
  request.                                                                            
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:82 Stores the fetched posts so the list renders.     
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:83 Opens the catch block to deal with errors.        
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:84 Extracts a readable message whether the thrown    
  value is an Error or not.
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:85 Saves the formatted error text for display.       
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:86 Resets the list to empty so the UI doesn’t show   
  stale data after a failure.                                                         
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:87 Starts the finally block that runs whether the    
  request succeeded or failed.                                                        
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:88 Marks loading as finished so the button re-       
  enables.                                                                            
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:92 Computes the button label based on state—initial  
  load, refreshing, or loading indicator.                                             
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:94 Begins the JSX output for the component.          
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:95 Wraps the content in a container for styling.     
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:96 Displays the section heading so users know what   
  the component is for.                                                               
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:97 Renders the trigger button and wires it to the    
  fetch handler.                                                                      
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:98 Shows the dynamic label describing the button’s   
  current action or state.                                                            
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:99 Closes the button element.                        
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:100 If an error exists, renders it so users see what 
  went wrong.                                                                         
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:101 Shows a friendly “No posts” message only after a 
  fetch attempt that returned nothing and no error.                                   
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:102 Opens the list container for the posts.          
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:103 Iterates over fetched posts so each title appears
  in the UI.                                                                          
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:104 Uses each post’s id as a React key and renders   
  the title.                                                                          
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:105 Closes the list item.                            
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:106 Closes the unordered list.                       
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:107 Closes the outer container.
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:108 Ends the JSX return.
  - src/Components/Archieves.tsx:109 Closes the component definition.
